# Task_3
If I understand the condition correctly, then the trader does not know what prices are in the town until he visits him. 
I decided that the trader should buy only the goods with the lowest price in the town (to minimize the risk) and sell them only when he finds a town where he can sell for more than he bought. 
Under such conditions and my realization, there is a small chance of losing money.
